# Honeycomb Instrumentation Examples

[![OSS Lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/osslifecycle/honeycombio/REPO)](https://github.com/honeycombio/home/blob/main/honeycomb-oss-lifecycle-and-practices.md)

The full power of Honeycomb is unlocked by proper instrumentation, especially at
the code level. The examples in this repository will help guide you
along the way to unlocking this power for yourself by showing you how
instrumentation is meant to be done.

Most of the top level directories in this repository correspond to an example
which demonstrates instrumentation using Honeycomb and sample queries to help
you along. The current examples are:
